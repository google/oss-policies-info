[^next-change]: This is an estimated date. The actual date may change if the
vendor (or community, as applicable) extends or shortens the lifetime of the
dimension in question.

[^rhel-7]: We require the [devtoolset-7] toolchain (compiler, linker, build
tools, etc.) on RHEL 7 and CentOS 7.

[^cmake]: We support the oldest version of CMake that ships with one of the
supported distros. Currently that is CMake 3.13 as Debian 10 ships with this
version.

[^gcc]: Once RHEL 7 reaches EOL we will support the oldest version of GCC
that ships with one of the supported distros.

[^clang]: We support the oldest version of Clang that ships with one of the
supported distros. Currently that is Clang 7.0 as Ubuntu 20.04 ships with
this version.
